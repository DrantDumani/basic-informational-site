    <h1>Hello friends, it is me.</h1>
    <p>
      I love using technology to create, which is what made me dive into
      programming. I enjoy making video games too so let me know if you want to
      work on something together. This project isn't really hosted anywhere. It
      only exists so that I can mess with Node JS.
