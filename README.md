# Basic Information Site

A project meant to test my knowledge with NodeJS. This was made while following [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/nodejs-basic-informational-site) curriculum. A follow up lesson asked me to rewrite the site using express.js.

It doesn't use any frameworks or libraries on the front end at all, since the focus was to make sure I had a proper understanding of NodeJS.

The live site can be found on this [replit](https://replit.com/@DJ-Landochu/basic-informational-site).
