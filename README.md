# Basic Information Site

A project meant to test my knowledge with NodeJS. This was made while following [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/nodejs-basic-informational-site) curriculum.

It doesn't use any frameworks or libraries on the front end at all, since the focus was to make sure I had a proper understanding of NodeJS.

The live site can be found on this [replit](https://replit.com/@DJ-Landochu/basic-informational-site).
